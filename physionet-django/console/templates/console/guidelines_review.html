      Guidelines for reviewers

    <p>When reviewing content, check that the requirements below are met. If not, you can copy the relevant points below into your message to the authors, preceded by "Please ensure that:".</p>

    <h4>All projects</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A README file is included alongside the files. At minimum, this file should include a title and a brief description of the package content.</li>
        <li>Sensitive data and protected health information have been removed.</li>
        <li>All files should be clearly named and must not include spaces (use underscores instead for increased readability) or special characters (e.g. "/","\,"."). Further, filenames should generally be lowercase (exceptions are "special files‚Äù, such as the RECORDS and ANNOTATORS files used for waveforms). Please use brevity when naming files (e.g. 1001abp.dat is better than subject_1001_ABP_wave_100Hz.dat).</li>
        <li>All files must be in open-source format and machine readable. Files in proprietary format, such as MatLab, Excel spreadsheet or Microsoft Word document, will not be supported, and must be converted to open-source format. For example, MatLab data, Excel spreadsheets, or Microsoft Word documents can be converted to CSV format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Data (general)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Large datasets: High resolution data/waveforms such as ECG and EEG recordings should be stored in WFDB compatible (or other open-source) format - either MIT or EDF format. There must also be information to obtain the physical values from these digital files, eg. the gain and baseline fields of MIT format header files.</li>
        <li>Small datasets: Open source formats such as text and CSV are permitted for small contributions, low resolution data and time series, and tabular information/relational databases.</li>
        <li>Tabulated data is arranged such that each variable is a column and each observation (or case) is a row ("tidy data").</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Data (waveforms)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The submitted project includes sufficient information to visualize waveforms in LightWave (i.e. RECORDS, *.hea, etc. files).</li>
        <li>The shape of waveforms is as expected when plotted as a timeseries.</li>
        <li>The *.hea files should contain descriptive signal names (no repeated signal names inside of the the same *.hea file, especially for large numbers of signals).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Software</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Instructions for installation and usage should be clearly documented. This should be adequate enough to reproduce project results.</li>
        <li>Dependencies should be clearly indicated, for example in a requirements file.</li>
        <li>A testing framework should be used to demonstrate correct functioning of major features of the software.</li>
        <li>Standard style guidelines should be followed where appropriate (for example, PEP8 for Python).</li>
        <li>The software should follow recommended software development practices. Further, the software should be logically structured and packaged according to standard practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The objective of the Challenge is clearly stated.</li> 
        <li>A timeline is provided, including a start date, final submission date, and scoring data.</li> 
        <li>The criteria for assessment are clear and unambiguous.</li> 
    </ul>
