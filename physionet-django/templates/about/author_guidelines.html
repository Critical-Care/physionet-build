  <h2 id="overview">Publication Process</h2>
  <p>These are the steps for publishing a resource on PhysioNet:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a project.</li>
    <li>Prepare the project for submission</li>
    {# This should match submission_checklist.html #}
    <ol>
      <li>Invite co-authors to be credited for creating the resource.</li>
      <li>Fill in the descriptive metadata.</li>
      <li>Set the access policy and license.</li>
      <li>Add identifiers.</li>
      <li>Upload the files.</li>
      <li>Preview the prospective published project.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Submit the project for review.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>An editor is assigned and makes a decision:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Reject - The content is not suitable for publication. Submission
          ends.</li>
        <li>Resubmit - The editor requests changes. The submitting author
          makes these changes and resubmits.</li>
        <li>Accept - The submission continues into the copyedit stage.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The editor copyedits the metadata and files for any final changes.
        When all authors approve, this editor can complete this step.</li>
      <li>The editor publishes the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="project-creation">Project Creation</h2>
  <p>An account is required for creating projects. The
     <a href="{% url 'create_project' %}" target="_blank">project
     creation page</a> can be found in the navbar under the
     <em>publish</em> panel, or your
     <a href="{% url 'project_home' %}" target="_blank">project
     home</a> page, which lists all of your authoring projects.
     Projects are not accessible by anyone except for their authors.
  </p>

  <p>When creating a project, choose the correct resource type, as
     this <strong>cannot be changed</strong> later. If you would like
     to contribute both data and code from a single related project,
     submit them in separate projects, and refer them to each other.</p>
  <br>

  <h2 id="authors">Preparing the Project for Submission</h2>
  <br>
  <h3 id="authors">1. Authors</h3>
  <p>Each project can have one <strong>submitting author</strong>, and
     many co-authors. The user who creates the project is the initial
     submitting author, though they can assign this role to another
     co-author if they want. Only the submitting author can invite,
     remove, and *order co-authors, fill in the project metadata,
     upload/edit files, and submit the project for review/publication.
     * The author order is the order in which author names will be
     displayed in the published project. The submitting author is
     responsible for preparing the project for submission, but does
     not need to be listed first.</p>

  <p>The submitting author can invite a co-author to the project by
     specifying an email address. An email will be sent to the target
     email address. If a PhysioNet account is already associated with
     the specified email, the invitation will appear in the user's
     <a href="{% url 'project_home' %}" target="_blank">project
     home</a> page. If not, once they associate the email to
     their existing account, or create a new account with the email,
     they will be able to view and accept the invitation in the
     aforementioned location.</p>

  <p>All authors must fill in their own affiliation information on a
     project by project basis, which is not tied to the affiliations
     listed in their PhysioNet profiles. Their names however, are
     tied to the names specified in the profiles. Non-submitting
     authors can view the project content as it is being prepared, but
     are unable to make any edits to the files and descriptive
     metadata. All non-submitting authors are required to approve
     project submissions initiated by the submitting author.

  <h3 id="files">5. Files</h3>
  <p>PhysioNet resources should be reusable by the greater scientific
      community. Data should be provided in an open format, such as
      text, csv, or wfdb. Large time-series data, especially
      physiological waveforms, should be provided in wfdb format. Code
      should be submitted in source format.</p>

  <p>Recall that only the submitting author can upload/edit files. All
     projects start with a moderately low size quota. The submitting
     author may request more storage if needed.</p>

  <h3 id="files">6. Preview</h3>

  <h2 id="review">Review Process</h2>
  <p>If the project passes all of its automatic checks, the submitting
     author may submit the project for review/publication. Once all
     the co-authors approve the review submission, a set of reviewers
     is assigned to the project. While under review, the project
     cannot be edited.</p>

  <p>Once all the reviewers have completed their review, the editor
     will make the decision to accept or reject the publication. If
     the, submission is accepted, a version of the project is published.
     If it is rejected, you may address the issues and resubmit.</li></p>
