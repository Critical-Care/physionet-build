  <h2 id="overview">Publication Process</h2>
  <p>These are the steps for publishing a resource on PhysioNet:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a project.</li>
    <li>Prepare the project for submission</li>
    {# This should match preparation_checklist.html #}
    <ol>
      <li>Invite authors to be credited for creating the resource.</li>
      <li>Fill in the descriptive metadata.</li>
      <li>Set the access policy and license.</li>
      <li>Add identifiers.</li>
      <li>Upload the files.</li>
      <li>Proofread your project and make sure it is ready for submission.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Submit the project for review.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>An editor is assigned and makes a decision:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Reject - The content is not suitable for publication. Submission
          ends.</li>
        <li>Resubmit - The editor requests changes. The submitting author
          makes these changes and resubmits.</li>
        <li>Accept - The submission continues into the copyedit stage.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>The editor copyedits the metadata and files for any final changes.
        When all authors approve, this editor can complete this step.</li>
      <li>The editor publishes the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="project-creation">Project Creation</h2>
  <p>An account is required for creating projects. The
     <a href="{% url 'create_project' %}" target="_blank">project
     creation page</a> can be found in the navbar under the
     <em>publish</em> panel, or your
     <a href="{% url 'project_home' %}" target="_blank">project
     home</a> page, which lists all of your authoring projects.
     Projects are not accessible by anyone except for their authors.
  </p>

  <p>When creating a project, choose the correct resource type, as
     this <strong>cannot be changed</strong> later. If you would like
     to contribute both data and code from a single related project,
     submit them in separate projects, and refer them to each other.</p>

  <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
  <p>If the project passes all of its automatic checks, the submitting
     author may submit the project for review, where an editor will be
     assigned. While under review, the project
     cannot be edited.</p>
