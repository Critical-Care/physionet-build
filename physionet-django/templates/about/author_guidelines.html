    <h2>Process Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Once a version of a project is published, it falls into the public domain and cannot be changed.
       Contributors will have no control over it. They may however edit their project and publish subsequent versions.</p>

    <p>It is important to separate the concepts of a project, and published versions of a project. A user may create a project and edit its fields. If it is submitted and accepted for publication, a version of the project is published, which falls into the public domain and cannot be edited. The original project </p>

    <h2 id="project-creation">Project Creation</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>An account is required for creating projects. The
       <a href="{% url 'create_project' %}" target="_blank">project
       creation page</a> can be found in the navbar under the
       <em>publish</em> panel, or your
       <a href="{% url 'project_home' %}" target="_blank">project
       home</a> page, which lists all of your authoring projects.</p>
    </p>

    <p>Projects are not accessible by, or even visible to anyone, except
       initially for the submitting author, and subsequently also for
       invited co-authors.</p>

    <p>When creating a project, choose the correct resource type, as
       this <strong>cannot be changed</strong> later. If you would like
       to contribute both data and code from a single related project,
       submit them in separate projects, and refer them to each other.</p>
    <hr>
    <br>


    <h2 id="authors">Authors</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Each project can have one <strong>submitting author</strong>, and
       many co-authors. The user who creates the project is the initial
       submitting author, though they can assign this role to another
       co-author if they want. Only the submitting author can invite,
       remove, and *order co-authors, fill in the project metadata,
       upload/edit files, and submit the project for review/publication.
       <em>*The author order is the order in which author names will be
       displayed in the published project</em>.</p>

    <p>The submitting author can invite a co-author to the project by
       specifying an email address. An email will be sent to the target
       email address. If a PhysioNet account is already associated with
       the specified email, the invitation will appear in its
       <a href="{% url 'project_invitations' %}" target="_blank">project
       invitations</a> page. If not, once they associate the email to their existing account, or create a new account with the email, they will be able to view and accept the invitation in the specified location.</p>

    <p>
        Co-authors must fill in their own affiliations.
        Co-authors can view the project content as it is being prepared,
        but are unable to make any edits to the files and descriptive metadata.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <br>


    <h2 id="access">Access Policies</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Once published, the descriptive metadata of any project will be
       publically available. The following access policies control access
       to the files:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Open</strong>: Anyone can access the files, as long as
            they conform to the terms of the license. No data use agreement
            (DUA) is provided.</li>
        <li><strong>Restricted</strong>: Only logged in users who sign the
            specified DUA can access the files.</li>
        <li><strong>Credentialed</strong>: Only PhysioNet credentialed users
            can access the files.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We strongly encourage using the 'open' access policy, and will
       reject non-open submissions that are not justified.</p>
    <hr>
    <br>


    <h2 id="files">Uploading Files</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Recall that
       only the submitting author can upload/edit files. All projects
       start with a moderately low size quota. The submitting author may
       request more storage if needed.</p>
    <hr>
    <br>

    <h2 id="review">Review Process</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>If the project passes all of its automatic checks, the submitting
       author may submit the project for review/publication. Once all the co-authors approve the review submission,
       a set of reviewers is assigned to the project.
    </p>

    <p>Once all the reviewers have completed their review, the editor
       will make the decision to accept or reject the publication.</p>
