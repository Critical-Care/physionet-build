## Development Workflow ##

Git Branches: 
- live - The live version of the website for the public.
- staging - The stable unreleased version of the website.
- dev - The unstable development branch.
- other personal branches - When adding new features, create them in a new branch. 

Work flow from **personal branches** --> **dev** --> **staging** --> **live**. Each merging stage requires a pull request.
